About
-----
Trunkoh.js is an intelligent text truncation JavaScript Library created by the MDC UX Team. Trunkoh.js is a library based on pure JavaScript, Trunkoh.js maximizes the amount of text visible in a selected container, without wrapping or overflowing. When applied to a text container, trunkoh will calculate the dimensions of the container and based on 

Usage
-----

**Default Settings**
```js
trunkoh('.foo'); // Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectâ€¦
```

By default, trunkoh will add an ellipsis (`&hellip;`) after the truncated text.

**Custom Settings**
```js
trunkoh('.foo',{
    fill: '[snip]',
    side: 'center'
}); // Lorem ipsum dol[snip]id est laborum.
```

You may change the settings at any time by passing an object to trunkoh. In the example above, the filler text is overwritten from an ellipsis to a custom string and the placement of the truncation is overwritten from the right side to the center. Continue reading the section below for a full list of customizable settings.

Settings
--------

* **fill** _(Default: '`&hellip;`')_ The string to insert in place of the omitted text. This value may include HTML.
* **lines** _(Default: `1`)_ The number of lines of text-wrap to tolerate before truncating. This value must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.
* **side** _(Default: `'right'`)_ The side of the text from which to truncate. Valid values include `'center'`, `'left'`, and `'right'`.
* **tooltip** _(Default: `true`)_ When true, the `title` attribute of the targeted HTML element will be set to the original, untruncated string. Valid values include `true` and `false`.

Public Methods
-------

**[Constructor]**
Initializes the settings and immediately truncates the targeted HTML element. This method is called when arguments are omitted and when the first argument is an object. When supplied with an object, trunk8 will merge the user-defined settings with the predefined settings object and immediately truncate the targeted HTML element with the custom settings.

```js
/* default settings */
trunkoh('.foo');

/* custom settings */
trunkoh('.foo',{
   lines: 2
});
```
